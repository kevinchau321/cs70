Dear CS70 Staff,

My login is CS70-zh.

After reviewing the released reader grades and comparing them to my own homework grades, I don't think that I had any issues with grade inflation on any of the 1-7 homeworks. However, on homework 8, for some a few of the virtual lab problem (specifically parts 2.8, 2.10, and 2.11), I was running out of time when making my writeup, so for the lab portion of the pdf I have code and comments for all the parts, but on the specific parts listed above I have only partial plots. For example, in the writeup itself for part 2.8, we are asked to have plots for p=.9,.6,.5,.4, and .3---I only showed the plots for .9, .6, and .5 due to time constraints, although the code i submitted should generate them all. I ended up giving my self partial credit for these incomplete plots, but I now realize that these are essentially "no file" parts that should be marked with 0 credit. For the most part I think that my solutions show that I did in fact understand the problem while doing the homework, which was why I gave my self partial credit. If the 70 staffs sees this as cheating, then I accept the punishments as described by the official policy, and hope that this one time isolated incident is not construed as excessive grade inflation.

Thank you,

Kevin Chau
