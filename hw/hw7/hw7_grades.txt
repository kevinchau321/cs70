#Problem 3.1: 4 
#Problem 3.2: 4 
#Problem 3.3: 4 
#Problem 4.1: 2 Did not consider minimum value of k, and missed the floor division in the solution
#Problem 4.2: 4 
#Problem 4.3: 2 Did not use part 2 to construct answer, incorrectly handled the floor and max functions 
#Problem 5: 4 
#Problem 6.1: 4 
#Problem 6.2: 1 because N is not prime, there are multiple solutions to the system of mod equations
